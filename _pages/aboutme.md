Hello! My name is Janis, born in 1989 in Speyer. For the past 9 years, I’ve been working in hardware development with a strong focus on EMC and PCB design. During this time, I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects in industries ranging from automotive to ex-equipment for industrial automation.

### My Story

My fascination with electronics started early, but it was my hands-on experience at Kyoto University, Infineon Technologies, Pepperl+Fuchs, and ABB Stotz Kontakt that truly shaped my career. Whether I’m optimizing PCB layouts for manufacturing efficiency or contributing to IP, I thrive on solving complex problems and embracing new technologies.

Outside of work, I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and share knowledge. From designing prototypes in my spare time to collaborating with cross-functional teams in professional settings, I find every challenge an opportunity to innovate.

### Looking Ahead

I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can continue pushing the boundaries in high-tech development. If you’re interested in discussing potential collaborations or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out!
