# Projects & Experience

Below is an overview of my hardware, software, and development projects over the years, from my most recent professional roles to earlier personal and academic work.

---

## (2021 – 2023) ABB AG, Hardware Developer
**Key Responsibilities:**
- Designed high-density interconnect (HDI) multilayer PCBs with an emphasis on thermal management, EMC, and ESD protection  
- Collaborated with schematic and mechanical design teams, supporting projects from prototype stages to mass production  
- Documented PCB design guidelines and processes for both internal reference and external suppliers  
- Oversaw external PCB design service providers and coordinated technical discussions with manufacturers  
- Managed Engineering Questionnaires (EQs) and Product Change Notifications (PCNs), including global PCB production relocation efforts

## (2018 – 2021) Pepperl+Fuchs SE PCB Layout Engineer
**Key Responsibilities:**
- Created multilayer PCBs for explosion-proof hardware in Cadence OrCAD/Allegro PCB Designer  
- Generated comprehensive manufacturing documentation and component libraries  
- Worked on FPGA-based processor board layouts (Intel Cyclone V) and related test boards  
- Conducted EMC measurements on various gateways and power supplies  
- Developed in-house tools for improved document management and component setup

## (2015 – 2018) Infineon Technologies, Internship & Early Career
- Performed EMC characterization of automotive sensors at both device and system levels  
- Employed standard EMC measurement methods (e.g., DPI, Radiated Emission, Radiated Immunity, ESD) using modern lab equipment such as DSOs, VNAs, and spectrum analyzers  
- Captured and evaluated data using NI LabVIEW, MATLAB, and Python  
- Developed specialized test boards (e.g., for DPI measurements) and test setups (e.g., for ESD measurements)  
- Contributed to improvements in ESD robustness for a MEMS pressure sensor

## (2014) Airbus Defence and Space, Master’s Thesis
**Topic:** “Multiple Hypothesis Solution Separation (MHSS) for GNSS Integrity Monitoring”  
- Implemented the MHSS algorithm in C++ within an existing GNSS simulation framework  
- Analyzed performance based on recorded GNSS data from a train environment  
- Assessed results against European standards for railway traffic management  
- Supported an ESA study exploring GNSS as an alternative to trackside balises

## (2014) Prototype 6-Channel Light Organ (Personal Project)
- Developed a multi-channel lighting controller with line-in audio detection (e.g., bass drum signals)  
- Utilized two microcontrollers—one for audio filtering, one for Triac-based light control  
- Incorporated galvanic isolation between high-voltage (230V) and logic circuitry  
- Assembled using Arduino-based firmware, perforated boards, and in-system programming  

---

## (Bachelor’s Thesis) KIT Electrical Engineering Institute
**Topic:** Control Program in MATLAB/Simulink for Coupled Electric Machines  
- Created a field-oriented control scheme for an asynchronous machine  
- Employed a DC machine as a controllable load, connected via a torque sensor on the shared shaft  
- Set up a seminar experiment to demonstrate varying load and generator scenarios  
- Documented the control dynamics and compiled a comprehensive guide for educational use  

---

## (2007) Internship in Optical Image Processing, Visolution GmbH
- Conducted feasibility studies on industrial image-processing solutions (e.g., paint inspection for beverage cans, contamination checks for medical products)  
- Utilized Cognex camera systems and associated development environments  
- Collaborated with PLC programmers and technicians to commission test stands (e.g., for common-rail pressure sensors)  

---

## (2006) “Vacuum Tubes” Research Paper (High School Project)
- Designed and documented various oscillator and amplifier circuits using an ECC83 triode  
- Explored circuit functionality, design principles, and hands-on experimentation  

---

## (2005) Prototype 8×5 Pixel LED Matrix (Personal Project)
- Created a battery-powered LED matrix to display simple animations or emojis  
- Programmed an ATMEL microprocessor on the STK-500 development board using Assembler  

---

## (2000 – 2009) Web Design & Websites (Hobby & Commercial)
- Built dynamic backends (forum software, CMS) leveraging PHP and MySQL databases  
- Employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end interfaces and interactive effects  
- Integrated external content over HTTPS with database-driven dynamic updates  
- Designed website graphics in Adobe Photoshop and incorporated 3D elements from Blender
